# filter
* This is my solution to the speller problem for CS50 2020 pset4.
* Simply it is a C program to perform filters to images like (Blur, Reflection, Grayscale and Sepia). 
* It was developed to work with linux opertaing systems. 
* link to pset4 -> https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/4/filter/less/
* USAGE : ./filter [flag] infile outfile
* flags are :
  1) -s for sepia.
  2) -g for grayscale.
  3) -b for blur.
  4) -r for reflection.
